 * 
 * Purpose: This program calculates the monthly payment for a loan based on a series of annual interest rates.
 * 
 * Note: Column formatting on this was working on the Dr. Java console/interactions pane, but not in the command line 
 * (Ubuntu 18.04 terminal doesn't seem to recognize \t consistently as a tab).
 * 
 * To remedy this so that the program works in any environment, I replaced tabs with spaces.
 * 
 * Obviously this is an approximation, but it works perfectly with the example given in the assignment description,
 * and it gets close with slightly larger or smaller monthly payments.
 * 
 * I tried to line up the assignment operators in each method while I was debugging 
 * so that the variables would stand out. After finding my mistake, I decided to finish 
 * the program *with* the alignment because it was easier to read. I know this isn't
 * everyone's favorite practice(as it's harder to modify without throwing off
 * formatting), but I hope it will work for all of you here.
